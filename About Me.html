            <H6>
                <p> Greetings,</p>
                <p>My name is Nikos, I’m 28 years old, I live in Kallithea, Athens, Greece. </p>
                I finished the technical high school as a computer and network technician and I’m working on this
                field
                from
                2012.
                After 2015 I decided to change my work field and learn more about programming.
                First I chose to study from a variety of sites like:
                1) coursera.org, 2) lynda.com, 3) codeacademy.com, 4) learnhowtocode.com ….</p>

                <p>At the same time I started making preparations in order to enroll in a university.
                    So in 2015 I took the English proficiency exams and started sending applications in some
                    universities
                    abroad. After considering both the pros and cons in each case, I decided to stay here in Greece and
                    enroll
                    in the Hellenic Open University, in computer science.</p>

                <p>Not long after that, I understood that even though the university could offer me some valuable
                    knowledge,
                    it
                    wouldn’t teach me programming itself.
                    So I made a new plan. This time I kept going with my uni plan but I would spend more time studying
                    programming on my own than studying for the uni itself.</p>

                <p>After some time, I met new people who are pursuing the same goal as me and with whom I could finally
                    discuss
                    about how things work on a practical level.

                    <p>As I was trying to understand which specific field I was more suited to, I did a variety of
                        courses
                        like:
                        Python seminars. Html, CSS, Bootstrap, Dreamweaver, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, jQuerry, CMS
                        (WordPress),
                        Git, C (both in and out of the uni), SQL and this period of time I’m learning Java and its
                        frameworks
                        (Spring, Maven, Hibernate).</p>

                    <p>Previous job
                        In my previous job I was working as a computer and network technician in a private company, in
                        which, except
                        my technical responsibilities I also had some programming duties.
                        As a technician I was offering tech services on the applications of the company (ERP programs).
                        I
                        was
                        creating private networks for the companies with which we had contracts.
                        We were working mostly with Microsoft’s products. MS SQL, etc..
                        From April 2018 I managed to enter the programming department of the company and was working on
                        an
                        accounting program. There I saw C#, .Net, MS SQL.</p>

                    ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


                    <p>After all these, I concluded, that the ideal job for me would be “Web Development” since I love
                        to
                        create
                        new things.
                        Since I mentioned creativity, it is about time to say that I also play the drums in a funk/rock
                        band,
                        “Groovy Peacocks”.
                        I don’t have a portfolio yet since I’m still on a junior level.
                        As I said above I believe that the best entry level job for me is working as a web developer,
                        either
                        with
                        CMS or dynamic and interactive webpages. I’m interested both in front and back-end.</p>
